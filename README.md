# `mootils`: Multi-objective optimization performance assessment utilities

Mootils is a joint project of the developers of jMetalPy (https://github.com/jMetal/jMetalPy) 
and Pymoo (https://pymoo.org), two Python-based frameworks for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics.

The project is aimed at offering the multi-objective optimization research community a set of utilities 
written in Python for performance assessment of results obtained with multi-objective metaheuristics. 
These utilities include quality indicators, visualization of fronts, and comparative analysis of experiments 
involving a number of algorithms.


### Quality Indicators

* Generational Distance
* Inverted Generational Distance
* Additive Epsilon

### Visualization

* Scatter plot
* Parallel coordinates

### Comparative Analysis
